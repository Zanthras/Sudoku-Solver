TOFIX/ADD:
 x-cycles need to be added. This will make it possible to see the last type of medusa in medusa4. Update: Not true anymore quad hinged is an alternate solve path. The 4th varient can be seen in the logs of the grid board, still need to program it in.

August 5th 2013
 Added the generic varient to my hinged matches, but limited to only size 4 as its slower than the the more specific size 3 varient, and I doubt its worthwhile to add a size 5.
 Added some basic per function solve time reporting

August 2nd 2013
 Slight changes to the solver messages to add more information
 Added a count of the solver functions to the main page

July 27th 2013
 Fixed a small bug in medusa chains, check if chains were found before forcing a read of the first entry...
 Added in the simple version of hinged matches, an example can be seen on medusa4

July 25th 2013
 Rewrote the logic behind hidden matches to support a wider variety of matches. [2,3], [3,6], [2,6] now properly counts as a triple. (The sum of the possibilities that appear in a group of cells must be the same as the number of cells. The contents of an individual cell dont matter.)
 Fixed a bug in naked matches incorrectly thinking all cells were in the same square when they werent.

July 24th 2013
 Added initial support for medusa or 3 dimensional simple chains. medusa boards added for example

July 21st 2013
 Added support for more than one possible start of a simple chain. It will now check every possible start location (that hasnt already been processed in a previous chain)

July 9th 2013
 Added new solving function Locked Pairs(2x2 grid)... locked pair example board added
 Cleaned up matched pair and made it less restrictive, also removed a pointless branch.
 Added new solving function Grids... (its a much less restrictive type of locked pairs... makes 3x3 and 4x4 grids with holes)
  grids example board added to showcase both sizes

July 8th 2013
 Added new solving function Corner intersection... weaklinks example board now solves

July 7th 2013
 All solvers ported to the new structure.
 Fixed a step bug in matched entries
 Added additional checking for naked entries to make them less stupid.
 Fixed num in line for being too restrictive in its check to trim, it now catches some obvious cases
 Added JS flair to report the cell you are mousing over (was easier to debug display problem)
 Inital code cleanup started to organize the modules better

July 4th 2013
 Rebuilt the main program flow to support a sane solve order.
 Ported the two most basic placement functions.

 Program Flows:
  Old: loop place num (basic solver)
            Trim board
             place num
              loop trim
  This results in it trimming when it should be placing
  
  New: Outer Loop:
        check for completion
        inner loop: try every function in order
         if progress break out of inner loop
  This results in trying the easy functions first, never hitting the hard ones until needed.

June 3rd 2013
 Updated binary chain logic to actually work with weak links. Split it off from the main binary chain function
 Fixed a bug in the make_loop function

June 2nd 2013
 Tried to add weak links to my binary chain... my understanding of weaklinks is flawed... reverting
 Updated find_excess_chain function to trigger on all excess matches (only was looking with a single line type, not all types at once)
 Updated invalid_chain_baord to trigger on all invalid chains (forgot to check columns and squares)

 updated trim_naked_matches to export to gamelog
 Colors! All gamelog exporting functions now also export color info
 publish board updated to silently complete all steps up to but not including the last step. The last step now wont remove possibilities and...
 updated publish board to support reading the color info and integrating it into the final table (redid the ptable portion completely) on the last step
 Fixed html formatting issue that cropped up after adding the colors to the table (screw you w3... im using depreciated stuff!)

May 29th 2013
 Updated the gamelog to understand steps
 Updated the gamelog to only show the details of the current step or every step on a solve
 Updated trim_ptable_for_num_in_line to export to gamelog
 Fixed corner case with gamelog for steps beyond the end not showing the final step
 Added all my test case boards as selectable examples

May 28th 2013
 Added logging

Pre-Web History:

v1.0: Can solve basic puzzles without resorting to possibilities
v2.0: Generates possibility table replicates v1 solving with possibility table
v2.1: Can trim possibility table for matched pairs
v2.2: Trim possibility table based off single number only line in a square
v2.3: for specific row/column if num in square and not in other square, clean rest of current square
v2.4: Updated matched pair to be length agnostic. Also allows for 2+ matches.
v2.5: Update matched function to not just match on [1,2,3] [1,2,3] [1,2,3] but also on [1,2,3] [1,2,3] [1,2,3,4] and remove the 4
v3.0: Converted to web based application for the front end UI
